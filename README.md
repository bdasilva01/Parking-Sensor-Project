# Parking Sensor Project
The Parking Sensor Project involves the development of a system designed to assist drivers in parking by providing real-time feedback on their proximity to obstacles.


### Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 Arduino Board
- Red, Yellow and Green LEDs
- Breadboard and Male-to-Male wires
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

### Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE

### Setup and Configuration
1. ESP32 Setup: Ensure that the ESP32 board manager is installed in the Arduino IDE.
2. Code Setup: Make sure the code is set up to run on the Arduino IDE software
3. Circuit Instrumentation: Connect ESP32 onto the breadboard alongside with HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor, RGB LEDs and 3V-DC buzzer.

### Code Explanation
- 

### How it Works
Once ESP32is powered on, put your hand 20-30cm away from sensor to show green, 10-20cm to show yellow and less than 10cm to show red and sound off the buzzer!
